# 🚀 Railway Deployment Steps

## Step 1: Connect to Railway

1. **Go to Railway**: https://railway.app
2. **Sign up/Login** with GitHub account
3. **New Project** → **Deploy from GitHub repo**
4. **Select Repository**: `Charlescifix/cifix_learn`
5. Railway will automatically detect the configuration from `railway.toml`

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

In Railway dashboard, add these variables:

### 🔐 Essential Security Variables (REQUIRED)
```bash
JWT_SECRET=XXXdELd_7fUv--YkgAWA1RzdVM3tkFWFy2KbiwqWc8M
ENCRYPTION_KEY=UsB01VVp0VOUEh_nVXNzk3nNK7SR1Z22d10v9fbPyqo
```

### 🗄️ Database Variables (Auto-provided by Railway)
Railway PostgreSQL will automatically set:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Full connection string
- `DB_HOST` - Database host
- `DB_PORT` - Database port (5432)
- `DB_NAME` - Database name (railway)
- `DB_USER` - Database user (postgres)
- `DB_PASSWORD` - Database password

### 🌐 Application Variables
```bash
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_URL=https://your-app-name.railway.app
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-app-name.railway.app
```

### 📧 Email Variables (Optional - for full functionality)
```bash
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-aws-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-secret
SES_SOURCE_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

## Step 3: Deploy

1. **Deploy**: Railway will automatically build and deploy
2. **Monitor**: Watch build logs in Railway dashboard
3. **Wait**: First deployment takes 3-5 minutes

## Step 4: Initialize Database

Once deployed, initialize the database:

### Option A: Railway CLI
```bash
railway login
railway link
railway run python backend/init_db.py
```

### Option B: Manual Connection
Use the DATABASE_URL to connect and run initialization scripts

## Step 5: Test Deployment

1. **Visit URL**: https://your-app-name.railway.app
2. **Test Frontend**: Landing page should load
3. **Test API**: https://your-app-name.railway.app/health
4. **Test Registration**: Create a test student account
5. **Test Dashboard**: Login and access student dashboard

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Build Failures
- Check Railway build logs
- Verify all environment variables are set
- Ensure `requirements.txt` has all dependencies

### Database Connection Issues
- Verify DATABASE_URL is correctly set
- Check database is running in Railway
- Test connection with Railway CLI

### Frontend Issues
- Check `config.js` API_BASE_URL
- Verify CORS settings
- Check browser developer console

## 🎯 Production Checklist

After deployment, verify:
- ✅ Homepage loads correctly
- ✅ API health endpoint responds
- ✅ Student registration works
- ✅ Login/logout functionality
- ✅ Assessment integration works
- ✅ Database queries execute
- ✅ Security headers present
- ✅ HTTPS enabled (automatic)

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **First Deploy**: May take 5-10 minutes
2. **Database Init**: Must run after first deployment
3. **Environment**: Double-check all required variables
4. **Domain**: Railway provides HTTPS automatically
5. **Logs**: Monitor Railway logs for any issues

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Railway build/deployment logs
2. Verify environment variables
3. Test database connection
4. Review CORS settings for your domain
